        title: "Enhancing Wi-Fi Signal Strength of a Dynamic Heterogeneous System Using a Mobile Robot Provider",
        authorlist: "Esther Rolf, Matt Whitlock, Byung-Cheol Min, Eric T Matson",
        conference: "RITA (Robot Intelligence Technology and Applications), 2013",

        abstract: "Heterogeneous networks of humans, robots, and agents are becoming increasingly common. Clients of wireless networks have continuously changing requirements for providers. In this project, a system to provide a sufficient signal for clients of a network as conditions change is proposed and validated. The system is comprised of hardware features such as a mobile access point and three heterogeneous client devices, and a movement algorithm. The mobile providerâ€™s autonomy is verified by the independence of initial position or orientation from success of the system. The system is designed for ease of reconfiguration; modularity in system design allows for advancements to be implemented simply and effectively."
